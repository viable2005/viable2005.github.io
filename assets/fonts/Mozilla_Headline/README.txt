Mozilla Headline Variable Font
==============================

This download contains Mozilla Headline as both a variable font and static fonts.

Mozilla Headline is a variable font with these axes:
  wdth
  wght

This means all the styles are contained in a single file:
  MozillaHeadline-VariableFont_wdth,wght.ttf

If your app fully supports variable fonts, you can now pick intermediate styles
that aren’t available as static fonts. Not all apps support variable fonts, and
in those cases you can use the static font files for Mozilla Headline:
