[00:00.23]Well they dress it up as mercy, say it’s heaven’s golden grin,
[00:06.30]But I see a traveling bazaar where justice gets traded in.
[00:12.28]If you’re flush, or wired, or famous—why, don’t you wring your hands;
[00:18.58]The law’s a porchlight flickering for those who grease the stands.
[00:24.81]Take young Trevor Milton, selling lightning in a jar—
[00:27.92]Made the stockmen weep for futures that never got that far.
[00:30.95]But he slipped my boys a bundle, and that’s the tune we play:
[00:33.98]Six-hundred million owed? Executive breeze just blows it away.
[00:37.10]And old Paul Walczak sailing on his tax-free sea of lies—
[00:40.21]Mama brings a million bucks, and suddenly he flies.
[00:43.24]Oh, “policy” and “oversight”—those tiny guardrail rails—
[00:46.51]They vanish like a snowflake for the friends who tip the scales.
[00:49.38]The Justice folks keep mumbling, “we should look case by case,”
[00:58.40]But I swapped their Pardon Man for one who knows his place.
[01:04.38]Now all the gears turn smooth again in this righteous MAGA mill—
[01:10.69]Where the motto on the wall reads: No Patriot Left Up-Hill.
[01:17.15]Sixteen hundred felons—give or take a wandering few—
[01:20.02]The list grows like a campfire fed with constitutional dew.
[01:23.21]We wiped away the fines, the debts—one point three billion gone;
[01:26.40]Victims left to haunt themselves while we whistle on the lawn.
[01:29.44]The rule of law’s a wedding vow we never meant to keep—
[01:32.63]It’s pretty on the parchment, but it’s obsolete and cheap.
[01:35.82]Consider David Gentile, weaving fraud like spider thread—
[01:38.85]A billion-six in vapor dreams, ten thousand folks misled.
[01:41.80]We sprung him like a jack-in-box before his stripes could fade;
[01:44.76]If you steal on a grand enough scale, well—that’s just how kings get made.
[01:47.79]And Georgie Santos in the mirror, sharer of my grin—
[01:51.78]A congressman of costume lies and showmanship and spin.
[01:55.61]I cut his sentence down to size, seems only fair to me—
[01:58.64]A loyal vote’s the only note in my sweet pardoning key.
[02:01.67]He lied about his story; I lie about the state—
[02:04.78]We’re artisans of scandal in a land we decorate.
[02:09.01]Oh the Constitution’s a whisper in a dusty museum hall,
[02:15.15]And the Pardon Power’s thunder—belonging to me and me alone, that’s all.
[02:21.78]Mason warned of monarchs, Randolph cried “betrayal’s near!”
[02:27.84]But treason’s just a slogan for the folks who aren’t in gear.
[02:33.27]I coin my mercy like silver, and spend it where it pays—
[02:40.45]Loyalty’s the only crime I wash away these days.
[02:46.75]Welcome to the Blockchain Blessing Boom!
[02:49.14]Where CZ Zhao strolls grinning from his courtroom gloom.
[02:52.02]Money laundering on the ledger, but he helped my memecoin climb—
[02:55.53]And good men who boost my balance seldom serve their time.
[02:58.64]BitMEX carved my face on tokens, whispered praise in neon rooms—
[03:01.75]So their founders got a pardon, spared the federal brooms.
[03:04.94]Justice is a junk-bond now, traded fast and thin—
[03:07.81]Courts are just reminder notes tossed in the political bin.
[03:12.44]Watch the markets buckle under, watch the civic lights decline—
[03:15.87]Everything moves quicker when the power’s wholly mine.
[03:21.70]The Founders thought impeachment had the teeth to bite me back—
[03:24.89]But partisanship’s a velvet rope that keeps me on my track.
[03:27.76]So I waved the wand for fifteen hundred Jan. 6 faithful souls—
[03:30.95]Brought bricks and peppered officers, but I absolved their roles.
[03:33.90]Rudy, Meadows, all the choirs who sang the false electors’ song—
[03:37.02]Seventy-seven early pardons so they wouldn’t wait too long.
[03:40.13]Randolph feared this very hour: a ruler shielding crime—
[03:43.24]Not mercy, friends, but cover—applied just in time.
[03:46.35]Oh the Constitution’s a footnote in an antiquated tome,
[03:51.38]And the Pardon Power’s a golden key to lock or open home.
[03:58.24]Mason cried of monarchy, Randolph rang of treason—
[04:04.70]But treason’s just my seasoning, sprinkled for each season.
[04:10.21]I trade in absolution, hand out judgments as I please—
[04:17.31]Loyalty’s the law now in the twilight of our breeze.
[04:22.02]A bargain… a betrayal… a discount justice store.
[04:29.76]Selling off the country cheap, piece by piece—no refunds anymore.
