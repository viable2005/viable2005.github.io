[00:00.23]Well they dress it up as mercy, say it’s
[00:03.67]heaven’s golden grin,
[00:06.30]But I see a traveling bazaar where
[00:08.93]justice gets traded in.
[00:12.28]If you’re flush, or wired, or famous
[00:15.47]—why, don’t you wring your hands;
[00:18.58]The law’s a porchlight flickering for
[00:21.94]those who grease the stands.
[00:24.81]Take young Trevor Milton, selling
[00:26.80]lightning in a jar—
[00:27.92]Made the stockmen weep for futures that
[00:29.68]never got that far.
[00:30.95]But he slipped my boys a bundle, and
[00:32.87]that’s the tune we play:
[00:33.98]Six-hundred million owed? Executive
[00:35.98]breeze just blows it away.
[00:37.10]And old Paul Walczak sailing on his tax
[00:39.25]-free sea of lies—
[00:40.21]Mama brings a million bucks, and
[00:42.04]suddenly he flies.
[00:43.24]Oh, “policy” and “oversight”—those tiny
[00:45.47]guardrail rails—
[00:46.51]They vanish like a snowflake for the
[00:48.19]friends who tip the scales.
[00:49.38]The Justice folks keep mumbling, “we
[00:55.85]should look case by case,”
[00:58.40]But I swapped their Pardon Man for one
[01:01.75]who knows his place.
[01:04.38]Now all the gears turn smooth again in
[01:07.73]this righteous MAGA mill—
[01:10.69]Where the motto on the wall reads: No
[01:13.80]Patriot Left Up-Hill.
[01:17.15]Sixteen hundred felons—give or take a
[01:19.38]wandering few—
[01:20.02]The list grows like a campfire fed with
[01:22.02]constitutional dew.
[01:23.21]We wiped away the fines, the debts—one
[01:25.21]point three billion gone;
[01:26.40]Victims left to haunt themselves while
[01:28.08]we whistle on the lawn.
[01:29.44]The rule of law’s a wedding vow we never
[01:31.75]meant to keep—
[01:32.63]It’s pretty on the parchment, but it’s
[01:34.46]obsolete and cheap.
[01:35.82]Consider David Gentile, weaving fraud
[01:37.81]like spider thread—
[01:38.85]A billion-six in vapor dreams, ten
[01:40.61]thousand folks misled.
[01:41.80]We sprung him like a jack-in-box before
[01:43.64]his stripes could fade;
[01:44.76]If you steal on a grand enough scale,
[01:46.35]well—that’s just how kings get made.
[01:47.79]And Georgie Santos in the mirror, sharer
[01:51.38]of my grin—
[01:51.78]A congressman of costume lies and showma
[01:54.01]nship and spin.
[01:55.61]I cut his sentence down to size, seems
[01:57.60]only fair to me—
[01:58.64]A loyal vote’s the only note in my sweet
[02:00.79]pardoning key.
[02:01.67]He lied about his story; I lie about the
[02:04.46]state—
[02:04.78]We’re artisans of scandal in a land we
[02:07.18]decorate.
[02:09.01]Oh the Constitution’s a whisper in a
[02:12.84]dusty museum hall,
[02:15.15]And the Pardon Power’s thunder—belonging
[02:18.66]to me and me alone, that’s all.
[02:21.78]Mason warned of monarchs, Randolph cried
[02:24.33]“betrayal’s near!”
[02:27.84]But treason’s just a slogan for the
[02:31.19]folks who aren’t in gear.
[02:33.27]I coin my mercy like silver, and spend
[02:37.65]it where it pays—
[02:40.45]Loyalty’s the only crime I wash away
[02:44.44]these days.
[02:46.75]Welcome to the Blockchain Blessing Boom!
[02:49.14]Where CZ Zhao strolls grinning from his
[02:51.14]courtroom gloom.
[02:52.02]Money laundering on the ledger, but he
[02:53.85]helped my memecoin climb—
[02:55.53]And good men who boost my balance seldom
[02:57.76]serve their time.
[02:58.64]BitMEX carved my face on tokens, whisper
[03:00.47]ed praise in neon rooms—
[03:01.75]So their founders got a pardon, spared
[03:03.51]the federal brooms.
[03:04.94]Justice is a junk-bond now, traded fast
[03:07.26]and thin—
[03:07.81]Courts are just reminder notes tossed in
[03:09.73]the political bin.
[03:12.44]Watch the markets buckle under, watch
[03:14.28]the civic lights decline—
[03:15.87]Everything moves quicker when the power’
[03:17.55]s wholly mine.
[03:21.70]The Founders thought impeachment had the
[03:23.53]teeth to bite me back—
[03:24.89]But partisanship’s a velvet rope that
[03:26.72]keeps me on my track.
[03:27.76]So I waved the wand for fifteen hundred
[03:29.76]Jan. 6 faithful souls—
[03:30.95]Brought bricks and peppered officers,
[03:32.55]but I absolved their roles.
[03:33.90]Rudy, Meadows, all the choirs who sang
[03:35.82]the false electors’ song—
[03:37.02]Seventy-seven early pardons so they
[03:39.01]wouldn’t wait too long.
[03:40.13]Randolph feared this very hour: a ruler
[03:42.44]shielding crime—
[03:43.24]Not mercy, friends, but cover—applied
[03:45.39]just in time.
[03:46.35]Oh the Constitution’s a footnote in an
[03:49.78]antiquated tome,
[03:51.38]And the Pardon Power’s a golden key to
[03:56.01]lock or open home.
[03:58.24]Mason cried of monarchy, Randolph rang
[04:02.87]of treason—
[04:04.70]But treason’s just my seasoning, sprink
[04:08.05]led for each season.
[04:10.21]I trade in absolution, hand out judgment
[04:14.68]s as I please—
[04:17.31]Loyalty’s the law now in the twilight of
[04:21.30]our breeze.
[04:22.02]A bargain… a betrayal… a discount
[04:27.36]justice store.
[04:29.76]Selling off the country cheap, piece by
[04:32.87]piece—no refunds anymore.
