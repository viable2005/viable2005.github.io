[00:11.96]They been sellin’ us sermons wrapped in
[00:16.11]dollar bills,
[00:18.43]Preachin’ holy borders from the top of
[00:22.33]the hill.
[00:24.17]The left hand whispers mercy, the right
[00:27.76]hand deals the game,
[00:30.07]But the dealer keeps the winnings and
[00:33.27]the players take the blame.
[00:35.90]And the night grows heavy,
[00:38.93]And the silence gets loud,
[00:41.96]Where’s the beating of the drum
[00:45.55]From the common crowd?
[00:50.50]We’re walking on a tightrope, with the
[00:53.85]balance wearing thin,
[00:56.56]The pundits wag the dog, while the crowd
[01:00.15]keeps tumblin’ in.
[01:02.31]But the rope don’t last forever, and the
[01:05.74]net is never found,
[01:08.29]Only mercy waits below us, standing on
[01:14.44]the common ground.
[01:21.70]One hand waves a banner, the other sha
[01:25.37]kes a cup,
[01:27.44]The workin’ man is waitin’, but the lad
[01:30.87]der’s broken up.
[01:33.19]They dress it up as progress, they dress
[01:36.86]it up as change,
[01:38.85]But it’s the same old hymn of hunger,
[01:42.44]sung in a different name.
[01:44.92]And the anger keeps rising,
[01:46.99]Like a storm that won’t rest,
[01:50.82]How did strangers steal the keys
[01:53.77]To the house we once possessed?
[02:00.39]They divide us into colors, into pulp
[02:03.43]its, into ranks,
[02:06.30]Preachin’ holy separation from the pul
[02:09.33]pit to the banks.
[02:12.44]The red hand blames the blue hand, the
[02:15.63]rich man blames the poor,
[02:16.99]But it’s the same old iron gateway
[02:21.22]keepin’ watch upon the door.
[02:24.17]And the fault lines get deeper,
[02:27.12]In the chapel and the town,
[02:30.00]But the river keeps remindin’ us
[02:33.51]We’re all drinkin’ from one ground.
[02:39.01]We’re walking on a tightrope, and the
[02:42.28]wire starts to sway,
[02:45.00]The pundits wag the dog, while the
[02:48.19]people look away.
[02:50.82]But the rope can’t hold forever, sooner
[02:54.01]or later we come down,
[02:56.64]And we’ll meet each other honest,
[03:00.31]standing on the common ground.
[03:09.33]There’s a mother with a candle, there’s
[03:12.60]a farmer with a plow,
[03:15.31]Both are prayin’ for their children,
[03:17.47]both are kneelin’ anyhow.
[03:21.22]There’s a soldier and a schoolteacher, a
[03:24.65]nurse behind a mask,
[03:27.04]Tryin’ to hold the line together, tryin
[03:30.39]’ to finish just the task.
[03:33.75]Strip away the labels, strip away the
[03:37.97]noise,
[03:39.17]All that’s left is the silence — and the
[03:42.52]trembling of a choice.
[03:44.12]So I knocked upon my neighbor’s door, he
[03:52.18]opened up his hand,
[03:54.81]We talked about the weather, and the
[03:58.08]worries of the land.
[04:00.79]His job’s been sent to ashes, my street’
[04:04.14]s been rearranged,
[04:06.46]But we both could see the fire wasn’t
[04:09.89]where they said it blazed.
[04:12.52]And the dawn starts hummin’,
[04:15.39]Like a tune that never dies,
[04:16.91]You can hear it if you listen
[04:21.94]In your brother’s eyes.
[04:28.72]Let the bosses count their profits, let
[04:31.83]the preachers count their souls,
[04:34.54]Let the pundits sell confusion while the
[04:37.97]cameras take their tolls.
[04:40.45]We’ll be writin’ our own story in the
[04:43.80]dirt and on the page,
[04:46.27]Where the meek inherit thunder, and the
[04:50.50]children set the stage.
[04:58.08]And the daylight is breakin’,
[05:01.03]On the lies that held us down,
[05:03.98]Time to trade the chains of anger
[05:07.57]For the weight of common ground.
[05:14.12]We’re walking off the tightrope, to the
[05:22.18]country we can build,
[05:24.73]Where the hunger meets its ending, and
[05:27.84]the promise gets fulfilled.
[05:30.55]Turn away from all the shouting, let the
[05:33.91]house of cards fall down,
[05:36.38]And we’ll find each other waiting,
[05:39.97]standing on the common ground.
[05:48.19]Yes, we’ll find each other waiting,
[05:52.57]Standing on the common ground.
