[00:11.96]They been sellin’ us sermons wrapped in dollar bills,
[00:18.43]Preachin’ holy borders from the top of the hill.
[00:24.17]The left hand whispers mercy, the right hand deals the game,
[00:30.07]But the dealer keeps the winnings and the players take the blame.
[00:35.90]And the night grows heavy, And the silence gets loud,
[00:41.96]Where’s the beating of the drum from the common crowd?
[00:50.50]We’re walking on a tightrope, with the balance wearing thin,
[00:56.56]The pundits wag the dog, while the crowd keeps tumblin’ in.
[01:02.31]But the rope don’t last forever, and the net is never found,
[01:08.29]Only mercy waits below us, standing on the common ground.
[01:21.70]One hand waves a banner, the other shakes a cup,
[01:27.44]The workin’ man is waitin’, but the ladder’s broken up.
[01:33.19]They dress it up as progress, they dress it up as change,
[01:38.85]But it’s the same old hymn of hunger, sung in a different name.
[01:44.92]And the anger keeps rising, like a storm that won’t rest,
[01:50.82]How did strangers steal the keys to the house we once possessed?
[02:00.39]They divide us into colors, into pulpits, into ranks,
[02:06.30]Preachin’ holy separation from the pulpit to the banks.
[02:12.44]The red hand blames the blue hand, the rich man blames the poor,
[02:16.99]But it’s the same old iron gateway keepin’ watch upon the door.
[02:24.17]And the fault lines get deeper, in the chapel and the town,
[02:30.00]But the river keeps remindin’ us we’re all drinkin’ from one ground.
[02:39.01]We’re walking on a tightrope, and the wire starts to sway,
[02:45.00]The pundits wag the dog, while the people look away.
[02:50.82]But the rope can’t hold forever, sooner or later we come down,
[02:56.64]And we’ll meet each other honest, standing on the common ground.
[03:09.33]There’s a mother with a candle, there’s a farmer with a plow,
[03:15.31]Both are prayin’ for their children, both are kneelin’ anyhow.
[03:21.22]There’s a soldier and a schoolteacher, a nurse behind a mask,
[03:27.04]Tryin’ to hold the line together, tryin’ to finish just the task.
[03:33.75]Strip away the labels, strip away the noise,
[03:39.17]All that’s left is the silence — and the trembling of a choice.
[03:44.12]So I knocked upon my neighbor’s door, he opened up his hand,
[03:54.81]We talked about the weather, and the worries of the land.
[04:00.79]His job’s been sent to ashes, my street’s been rearranged,
[04:06.46]But we both could see the fire wasn’t where they said it blazed.
[04:12.52]And the dawn starts hummin’, like a tune that never dies,
[04:16.91]You can hear it if you listen in your brother’s eyes.
[04:28.72]Let the bosses count their profits, let the preachers count their souls,
[04:34.54]Let the pundits sell confusion while the cameras take their tolls.
[04:40.45]We’ll be writin’ our own story in the dirt and on the page,
[04:46.27]Where the meek inherit thunder, and the children set the stage.
[04:58.08]And the daylight is breakin’, on the lies that held us down,
[05:03.98]Time to trade the chains of anger for the weight of common ground.
[05:14.12]We’re walking off the tightrope, to the country we can build,
[05:24.73]Where the hunger meets its ending, and the promise gets fulfilled.
[05:30.55]Turn away from all the shouting, let the house of cards fall down,
[05:36.38]And we’ll find each other waiting, standing on the common ground.
[05:48.19]Yes, we’ll find each other waiting, standing on the common ground.
