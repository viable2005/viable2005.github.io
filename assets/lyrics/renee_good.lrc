[00:20.66]The mercury is hiding in the bottom of the glass,
[00:25.21]while the shadows of the Northland come to pass.
[00:28.96]A maroon Honda Pilot idles on the Portland Avenue ice,
[00:34.22]where the cost of a conscience is a heavy, frozen price.
[00:39.09]Renee, the poet, with a degree in the King’s own tongue,
[00:43.08]had just left her six-year-old where the schoolhouse bells are rung.
[00:47.55]She wasn’t an activist with a brick or a master plan,
[00:51.46]just a legal observer in a weary, worried land.
[00:56.17]But the wind-chill is biting at negative twenty degrees,
[01:00.55]and the air is thick with the scent of an ancient, dark disease.
[01:04.94]A mother of three, a writer of rhymes,
[01:08.85]caught in the gears of these hollow, showy times.
[01:17.95]Out steps the agent, Jonathan Ross is his name,
[01:21.94]with a phone in his left hand to record the deadly game.
[01:25.13]He’s a Swat-team veteran from the Mesopotamian sands,
[01:30.31]now bringing "Metro Surge" to the city where the citizen stands.
[01:35.34]Three thousand masked men, an "occupying force" in the street,
[01:39.25]outnumbering the local law in a dance of cold deceit.
[01:43.64]Conflicting orders scream through the January haze:
[01:47.55]"Drive away!" then "Get out!" in a terrifying maze.
[01:52.18]She veers to the right, just trying to find a way through,
[01:56.17]as the agent stays upright—ay, the video tells it true.
[02:00.79]Three shots ring out in a second, shattering the glass,
[02:04.78]while the ghosts of the Constitution watch the funeral pass.
[02:09.33]It’s 1970 again on a new Blanket Hill,
[02:13.24]where the "unnecessary and unwarranted" shooters have their fill.
[02:17.55]The ghost of Allison Krause whispers "flowers are better than lead,"
[02:22.18]while the "bums" of the campus are now numbered with the dead.
[02:26.48]Trump holds the Bible and threatens the Insurrection Act,
[02:30.47]while his aides weave a tapestry of fiction over fact.
[02:35.10]From Birmingham’s dogs to the hoses of 1963,
[02:39.09]they’re using "chemical agents" to stifle the plea of the free.
[02:43.64]They’ve purged the officials who wouldn't bow to the crown,
[02:47.63]and they’ve placed the whole city under a "polycratic" frown.
[02:52.10]Oh, Renee is the spark, the new Kent State flame,
[02:56.56]While the palace of power forgets her children’s name.
[03:00.79]They call her a "terrorist" for dropping a child at the gate,
[03:04.94]In a "nightmare" of "occupation" fueled by institutional hate.
[03:09.09]The video is screaming, but the propaganda is loud,
[03:13.56]As the shadow of the autocrat falls over the crowd.
[03:18.27] The state of Minnesota is taking a stand,
[03:21.27] Suing the "occupation" to get them off the land.
[03:26.70] But the "enemy from within" is the new party line,
[03:30.19] While the "blood of the country" is turned into wine.
[03:34.79] It’s 1938 in a Minneapolis park,
[03:39.79] Where the semiautomatic weapons point into the dark.
[03:46.19]The President rants that she "ran the officer down,"
[03:49.86]despite the forensic truth that has echoed through the town.
[03:54.09]Ross suffered "internal bleeding," or so the Secretary said,
[03:57.60]but there’s no medical record, just a script for the misinformed head.
[04:02.95]They’re investigating the widow, Becca, for a "taunt" in the snow,
[04:06.94]while the DOJ lets the shooter of the mother go.
[04:11.25]Walz and Frey are the "conspirators" in the official view,
[04:15.31]for asking the "modern-day Gestapo" to say their adieu.
[04:19.78]It’s the "forced alignment" of every department and law,
[04:24.33]where the "controlling view" is the only one they saw.
[04:28.40]Eighty percent of the shops have pulled down the shade,
[04:32.55]as the "existential crisis" of the republic is made.
[04:39.09]Oh, Renee is the spark, the new Kent State flame,
[04:43.24]While the propaganda machine tries to bury the shame.
[04:47.55]Calling a mother of three a "terrorist" in her own car,
[04:51.78]While the "polycratic" authority hides behind the star.
[04:56.01]The video is screaming, the eyewitnesses too,
[05:00.55]But the "King" in his crown has no use for the truth.
[05:12.44]So, blow your whistles, Minneapolis, let the electric guitars wail.
[05:23.69]Against the "legal revolution" that’s making the democracy frail.
[05:34.06]The classrooms are empty, but the streets are alive,
[05:37.89]Where the "People’s Action Coalition" is fighting to survive.
[05:42.84]Justice for Renee is the cry in the night,
[05:46.35]Until the day when the truth finally comes to the light.
[06:10.45]Listen to the "rhetorical flourish,"
[06:14.68]listen to the "propaganda".
[06:18.52]They say she was a "domestic terrorist".
[06:27.04]The Secretary said, "It absolutely is what happened,"
[06:32.31]even when the New York Times showed them the tape.
[06:35.44]The President said, "I find it hard to believe the agent is alive,"
[06:42.08]while the man was standing on his own two feet the whole time.
[06:48.15]"Poisoning the blood of our country," they scream from the rallies.
[06:52.50]"Bad genes," they whisper about the neighbors.
[06:56.31]"Fucking bitch," muttered the agent as her car hit the light pole.
[07:02.71]"Altamente paid professionals,"
[07:06.14]"traitors," "insurrectionists," "moronic."
[07:09.85]"Which way, American man?". "Love-Fuck-ya-King".
[07:20.62]But the whistle is blowing.
[07:24.10]The whistle is blowing.
[07:28.50]The whistle is blowing.
[07:33.27]The whistle is blowing.
