[00:23.77]Well, the auctioneer’s down in Mar-a-Lago, where the walls are made of cheese,
[00:31.19]Sellin’ phantom ships on credit with a trademarked salty breeze.
[00:34.94]Says, “I need two dozen battleships, the classiest ever seen!
[00:41.25]Each one dipped in 24-karat and painted with a scowl so mean!”
[00:50.66]Yeah, the contractors are dancin’ in a desperation waltz…
[00:56.32]He points at some old napkin where his crazy was engrossed,
[00:59.68]Says the deck will be of marble where the admirals can golf!
[01:03.03]And the only thing it’s missin’ is an anchor and a prop.
[01:06.14]And the shipyard boys just stare at nothin’, chewin’ on their chaw…
[01:11.72]Now behold the grand USS Defiant, subject to a licensing fee,
[01:18.19]It’s longer than your memory and twice as blind as it can be.
[01:24.65]Got a penthouse for the Captain and a casino for the mates,
[01:28.08]And a button for the missiles that he sold to several states.
[01:31.35]It’s the art of the deal, baby, on a hull that’s lean and mean…
[01:34.78]Well, the lasers run on promises, the reactors run on steam,
[01:37.34]From a boiler stoked with depositions and a patriot’s pure esteem.
[01:41.09]And the bow’s a giant screen, friends, where he wins the war all day,
[01:47.31]While the barnacles below the line are plottin’ how to get their pay.
[01:50.74]And the waves, they don’t read contracts, they just mock you and they roll…
[01:57.12]Now the real fleet’s in the shipyard, rustin’ quiet in the rain,
[02:00.31]While Trump christens a new PowerPoint with a bottle of champagne.
[02:03.75]He fired the old designers ’cause they mentioned “weight” and “keel,”
[02:07.02]Now the blueprint’s by a stylist who knows how a boss should feel.
[02:10.37]And the deficit, it’s just a number someone scribbled on a sack…*
[02:13.88]So they’ll melt a hundred tomahawks to cast a golden plaque,
[02:17.07]And they’ll scrap the Constellation just to build a bigger plaque!
[02:20.34]It’s a floating gated community to scare the (RED) Chinese blue,
[02:26.25]With a food court and a spa, but the heads don’t flush for you.
[02:30.55]No, the heads don’t flush for you…
[02:33.27]So sail on, Trump-Titanic, you carnival on the foam!
[02:39.49]You gilded-age revenge dream, far too heavy to leave home.
[02:42.52]With your cannons that fire lawsuits and your radar locked on “fraud,”
[02:45.95]You’re the flagship of a navy now, a frumpy, Trumpy, facade.
[02:49.22]Oh, the press release is mighty, but the water’s mighty deep,
[02:52.34]And the whole world’s just a-watchin’ a promise you'll never keep…
[02:55.61]Trump is Dancin’ on a plated bridge while the engineers just weep.
[03:02.07]Now the welder in Virginia, he just scratches at his head,
[03:05.42]Says, “I’ve seen some renderin’s before, but I never seen this 'red'.”
[03:08.37]He’s got a chart that shows the workload, it’s a cliff that’s straight and tall,
[03:11.88]And a memo ’bout the gold leaf that’s required to cover all.
[03:15.15]And the safety man, he’s shakin’, check-in’ regulations twice…*
[03:18.27]Well, the Admirals in their bunkers, they’re cuttin’ deals on rice,
[03:21.62]Tradin’ two real submarines for one set of golden dice.
[03:24.89]And the critics, they’re all howlin’ like dogs chained to a tree,
[03:27.92]While the Jester King just tweets "SAD!"
[03:30.23]from across the open sea.
[03:31.75]Yeah, the truth it sunk already, with a quiet, final sound…
[03:37.02]So sail on, Trump-tanic, you monument to gall!
[03:40.85]A hotel suite with torpedoes meant to please a vengeful Saul.
[03:44.12]With your name on every lifeboat, that they never quite installed,
[03:47.55]You’re the answer to a question that the waves never called.
[03:50.74]Oh, the donors all are cheerin’ from a yacht that’s real and leased,
[03:53.93]While you’re fadin’ to a legend ’bout a bankrupt, boastful beast…
[03:57.28]A beautiful, enormous, very lonely, golden feast.
[04:03.59]Yeah, the tide don’t read the polls, boys… the salt, it eats the gilt.
[04:06.86]And the bill comes in the mornin’ for the mansion that was built…
[04:10.53]On the quick-dryin’ foam… of a boast that’s startin’ to wilt…
[04:13.88]In the dark, silent yard… where the real steel’s startin’ to tilt…
[04:21.54]And the sea… she keeps her secrets… but she sends the final invoice…
[04:29.04]For the Golden Fleet of Mirrors… and the echo of Trump's voice…
