[00:23.53][Verse 1]
[00:23.53]Eight warships storm the water, nuclear
[00:27.44]ghost below,
[00:29.76]Fighter jets circle fishermen where the
[00:33.51]trade winds blow.
[00:35.42]They branded Chad Joseph “terrorist
[00:39.17]”, and sent him to the deep,
[00:41.88]While Colombian mothers cry beneath the
[00:45.39]banners of deceit
[00:47.39]Twenty-seven lovers ashes drown, no tri
[00:50.66]al, no proof in hand,
[00:53.13]“Presidential orders raining fire from
[00:56.64]the roof,” they stand.
[00:59.44]Semi-subs blasted silent, survivors sent
[01:04.22]away,
[01:05.10]To dodge the courts that might expose
[01:07.97]this deadly play.
[01:12.92]They say it’s not a war — but the bodies
[01:15.95]tell the tale,
[01:19.22]International waters painted red for man
[01:21.62]ufactured “scale.”
[01:23.85]War is peace when you need an enemy to
[01:26.48]feed,
[01:26.88]Freedom’s death when you strike first
[01:28.88]and ask why you bleed.
[01:30.00]Ignorance is strength when you hide the
[01:31.67]evidence away,
[01:32.55]“We’ve always been at war with the cart
[01:34.54]els” — or so they say.
[01:35.74]Justice, justice, bring the truth into
[01:38.13]the light,
[01:38.61]For the fishermen who vanished in the
[01:40.53]Caribbean night.
[01:45.63]UNCLOS says you board them; you don’t
[01:49.86]blow them from the sky,
[01:52.65]Self-defense demands a threat—not a
[01:56.09]shoot-first-ask-why.
[01:58.64]Extrajudicial killings dressed in a
[02:02.39]righteous fight,
[02:04.54]Article 2 point 4 broken every single
[02:08.85]night.
[02:10.45]Venezuelan waters, Ecuadorian men,
[02:14.91]Colombian citizens asking — when will
[02:19.86]this madness end?
[02:22.18]The High Commissioner screams while the
[02:25.37]bombs keep falling down,
[02:28.00]And Trinidad demands answers that will
[02:32.07]never be found.
[02:36.14]Repatriate the survivors so they never
[02:38.29]see a judge,
[02:41.16]Keep the “armed conflict” narrative
[02:43.80]buried in the sludge.
[02:46.03]Forever war — forever more — the enemy
[02:48.83]just shifts his name,
[02:49.86]Drug war, terror war — pick your banner,
[02:52.10]play your game.
[02:52.73]Orwell saw it coming: the perpetual by
[02:55.29]design,
[02:55.69]Ministry of Truth rewriting deaths as
[02:57.76]“victory lines”.
[02:58.72]CIA in the shadows, covert ops deployed,
[03:03.83]Sovereign nations violated — internation
[03:07.89]al law destroyed.
[03:09.41]“Can’t win against a concept, can’t
[03:12.68]defeat an endless threat”,
[03:13.96]But victory’s not the purpose — it’s the
[03:19.46]power that you get.
[03:22.18]The Ministry of Peace sends submarines
[03:24.73]back in,
[03:28.08]The Ministry of Truth rewrites each kill
[03:30.71]as a win.
[03:33.03]Oceania’s at war with narco-Eastasia
[03:36.70]today,
[03:39.33]Tomorrow it’s Eurasia—but the bombs
[03:43.48]still find their way.
[03:45.00]No habeas corpus for the drowned beneath
[03:49.22]the waves,
[03:50.90]No evidence presented, just unmarked
[03:54.97]ocean graves.
[03:57.12]Tele-screens stream videos of smoke and
[04:01.43]flame,
[04:02.87]While lawyers quote Geneva Conventions
[04:06.06]all in vain.
[04:11.25]How many fishermen must die for this imp
[04:13.24]erial charade?
[04:13.96]How many families left grieving in this
[04:18.03]so-called drug crusade?
[04:21.62]War is peace when you need an enemy in
[04:24.25]place,
[04:24.65]Freedom’s death when you strike with ar
[04:26.64]bitrary grace.
[04:27.76]Ignorance is strength when you bury the
[04:29.60]facts away,
[04:30.31]We’ve always been at war with the cartel
[04:32.39]s—or so they say.
[04:33.51]Justice, justice, hear the families cry,
[04:35.98]For Chad, for Colombia, for those who
[04:38.29]shouldn’t die.
[04:39.41]Justice, justice — let the ICC convene,
[04:41.96]For the arbitrary killings in the Carib
[04:44.36]bean Sea.
[05:19.78]War is peace… war is peace… war is
[05:44.52]peace…
