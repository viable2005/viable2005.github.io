[00:21.46]In the concrete canyons where the landl
[00:23.93]ord is king,
[00:24.49]With a felt-tip pen making the "C" for
[00:26.41]"colored" sing.
[00:27.20]Refusing the rent to the dark-skinned
[00:29.04]crew,
[00:29.36]A ninety-seventy-five decree for the
[00:31.35]red, white, and blue.
[00:32.71]Then a full-page polemic for the Central
[00:34.70]Park Five,
[00:35.66]Wishing for the rope while they’re
[00:36.94]barely alive.
[00:37.97]Exonerated boys, but the man stays the
[00:40.37]same,
[00:40.69]Still defending the stance, still fan
[00:42.52]ning the flame.
[00:43.32]He's a medicine man for the "Birther"
[00:45.31]disease,
[00:45.95]Claiming Kenya's the home on the trop
[00:47.79]ical breeze.
[00:48.43]To the mash-un-TUCK-it PEE-kwaht, he
[00:50.26]says with a sneer,
[00:51.14]"You don't look like Indians" in a
[00:52.73]revealing on air smear.
[00:53.93]Then he rides down the gold-plated escal
[00:55.85]ator slide,
[00:56.56]Calling neighbors "rapists" on a xenopho
[00:58.64]bic ride.
[00:59.20]With "drugs" and with "crime" in a ra
[01:00.87]cialized brew,
[01:01.67]A hardline sermon for the chosen few.
[01:04.38]Oh, John Pory was the first with the Af
[01:06.22]rican pen,
[01:06.54]And Woodrow Wilson segregated the fed
[01:08.85]eral men.
[01:09.81]Andrew Jackson's trail was a path made
[01:11.72]of tears,
[01:12.52]But a new ghost rises from the eugenics
[01:14.52]years.
[01:15.07]Joseph Arthur duh goh-bin-OH's hierarchy
[01:17.15]of old,
[01:17.63]Is dusted off now in a story oppulently
[01:19.78]told.
[01:20.10]Scientific Racism in a gilded new-age
[01:22.57]suit,
[01:22.81]With a Truth Social bird and a bitter,
[01:25.05]dark fruit.
[01:25.85]Deeper than the scholars in the eugenics
[01:39.09]books,
[01:40.37]It's all in the tweets and the "D E I"
[01:44.60]hooks.
[01:47.31]Catchier than a jingle, colder than the
[01:48.98]ICE,
[01:49.22]In the Golden Age of the weighted racial
[01:51.30]ized dice.
[01:52.26]Stephen Miller in the basement with the
[01:53.93]vee-DAR-uh feed,
[01:54.89]Sowing Camp of the Saints like a nation
[01:56.72]alist seed.
[01:57.52]Leaked emails flowing like a poisonous
[01:59.76]wine,
[02:00.15]Drawing a hard, eugenics-era line.
[02:02.47]Paraphrasing Hitler's laws with a policy
[02:04.94]grin,
[02:05.50]Where the "Great Replacement" is the
[02:07.26]original sin.
[02:08.21]Fast forward to twenty-twenty-six, the
[02:10.05]latest display,
[02:10.85]The Obamas as primates in a jungle-theme
[02:13.08]d fray.
[02:13.48]"The Lion Sleeps Tonight" while the face
[02:15.31]s are blurred,
[02:15.95]A blatant trope from the seventy-nine
[02:17.95]-year-old's word.
[02:18.75]The white hous excuse, "Lion King," it's
[02:20.82]just a meme, see?,
[02:22.10]Before they blame an aide for the bigot
[02:24.09]ry.
[02:24.25]No apology offered, no regret in Leav
[02:26.09]itt's burning crossed eyes
[02:27.44]Just the "shithole" rhetoric and the
[02:29.04]"garbage" of lies.
[02:31.99]It's a legacy of provocation, sets of hy
[02:34.86]sterical scenes,
[02:37.50]In the land of the brave and the... qu
[02:39.41]ote... "very fine" means.
[02:42.36]Rivaling duh goh-bin-OH in the scientif
[02:44.68]ic dark,
[02:45.15]Leaving a "poh-kuh-HAHN-tuhs" and a
[02:46.91]"shithole" mark.
[02:47.71]Meme-worthy madness in a 2 A M trance,
[02:50.58]While the G O P leaders do their usual
[02:52.65]silence dance.
[03:03.19]"Go back" to your countries, the Cong
[03:05.42]ress-women hear,
[03:06.62]A dog whistle blowing in the national
[03:08.69]ear.
[03:09.17]From the ninety-seventy rentals to the
[03:10.85]jungle-themed post,
[03:11.80]He's the anti-King host with the most of
[03:13.96]the racist ghost.
[03:15.00]Salute the flag, boys, but ignore the
[03:17.31]sheets,
[03:19.38]Only the "fine people" are marching on
[03:23.29]the Truth Social streets.
