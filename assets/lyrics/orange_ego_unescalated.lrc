[00:25.69]Well Dozy Don rolled into town with his entourage in tow
[00:29.52]Stepped on that escalator and wouldn't you know
[00:38.05]The whole damn thing just groaned and died, gears grinding to a halt
[00:43.96]But Don just crossed his arms and said "This ain't my fault!"
[00:49.22]His orange foundation dripping down into the moving stairs
[00:55.85]While secret service just stood around with thousand-yard stares
[01:01.35]He's got the touch, the Anti-Midas touch
[01:05.26]Everything he grabs turns into rust
[01:07.73]But his ego's bigger than the mess he makes
[01:10.77]And somebody else always takes the blame
[01:14.20]Dozy Don’s glitchin’ in a breakdown, breakdown,
[01:17.87]Throwin’ orange neon fingers all across apple town.
[01:21.30]“IT’S EVERYBODY’S FAULT BUT MINE!”
[01:24.57]he howls through a China cracked phone,
[01:26.80]While the United Nations just want to teleport him home.
[01:33.35]Yeah, Dozy Don’s glitchin’ in a breakdown, breakdown—
[01:37.57]We sip our synth-jazz watching his meltdown.
[01:55.69]Teleprompter fizzed, sparked out, then died—
[01:58.80]His face lit orange, like a nuclear sun rise.
[02:01.59]“IT’S SABOTAGE!” he roared at the holo graphic corps,
[02:07.89]“THE ANTIFA HOLOGRAMS AND EX-PRESIDENTS STARTED THIS WAR!”
[02:14.12]Typing in all caps, 3AM cyber-spasms,
[02:19.86]Conspiracies bouncing like basslines through the plasm.
[02:25.85]State media choirs hum every syllable he spills,
[02:29.68]Broadcasting to pixel-zombies on prescription pills.
[02:38.13]Elder dreamers hypnotized in static-lit caves,
[02:43.80]While Don keeps smashing mirrors and cursing the slaves.
[02:49.94]Old allies now cross cyber-streets in disguise,
[02:52.81]Friendships that took centuries, digitized and vaporized.
[02:55.93]Trade deals collapse like origami in rain,
[02:58.64]While Don’s orange wallet bloats with every campaign.
[03:01.59]Zombie evangelical watchers wire him their last pension-byte,
[03:07.34]He points to Donkey holograms, screaming repent into the night.
[03:13.64]“The donkeys coded it!
[03:15.71]The donkeys broke the grid!”
[03:16.59]While his own base lives on less than a mid-tier bid.
[03:19.78]Economic bridges flaming orange neon bright,
[03:22.65]But Don keeps riffing christian hashtags inflaming the right.
[03:26.25]Dozy Don’s glitchin’ in a breakdown, breakdown,
[03:29.91]Throwin’ orange neon fingers all across apple town.
[03:33.43]“IT’S EVERYBODY’S FAULT BUT MINE!”
[03:36.62]he howls through a China cracked phone,
[03:38.85]While the United Nations just want to teleport him home.
[03:45.31]Yeah, Dozy Don’s glitchin’ in a break down, breakdown,
[03:49.54]We sip our synth-jazz watching his meltdown.
[04:07.89]Spotlight podium, hair like static flame,
[04:10.85]“BROKEN ESCALATORS! BROKEN LAND!
[04:12.92]YOU’RE ALL TO BLAME!
[04:14.04]My teleprompters shatter ‘cause I’m too divine,
[04:16.75]I’m Beethoven of politics, your systems out of time!”
[04:20.26]delegats stare, bemused in hologram awe,
[04:25.85]As orange dust clogs the speakers, glitches the law.
[04:30.23]“I forged peace in lands I can’t even pronounce!”
[04:37.10](Whisper in a different accented voice)
[04:37.50]The UN whispers “that was us” but not a soul will pounce.
[04:41.96]“I fixed the crises that I swore I never made!
[04:50.10]I rebuilt your worlds while you all just decayed!”
[04:55.93]He clutches the mic for a cyberpunk stand—
[04:58.88]It pixelates, crumbles, dissolves in his hand.
[05:01.43]Feedback shrieks, the circuit dies, Jazz silence floods the hall.
[05:07.89]Even his echo chamber can’t amplify the sprawl.
[05:18.67]Dozy Don had his breakdown, breakdown—
[05:22.33]Finally muted in this wired town.
[05:25.85]The chamber erupts in thunderous applause,
[05:29.12]Not for his voice, but the merciful pause.
[05:31.67]Yeah, Dozy Don had his breakdown, breakdown,
[05:34.62]We raise our glasses as he winds down.
[05:38.13]Dozy Don’s breakdown, breakdown—
[05:42.36]His finest speech was the absence of
[05:50.50]sound.
