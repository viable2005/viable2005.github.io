[00:09.97]Old Hegseth paints his ladies mask, roug
[00:12.92]e thick as winter clay,
[00:16.19]Preaches soldier’s gospel—“no mascara or
[00:19.14]beards in the fray.”
[00:22.57]He blames the bulging bellies for the
[00:25.05]empire’s slow decline,
[00:27.92]But the mirror mocks his powdered face,
[00:32.07]and the President's waistline.
[00:35.26]“Resign if you won’t follow me,” he mut
[00:38.53]ters through the paint,
[00:40.45]And silence drapes the generals, their
[00:43.96]patience worn but faint.
[00:48.03]They flew from foreign garrisons, from
[00:50.34]Kaisers’ ghostly halls,
[00:52.26]To hear of phantom saboteurs who live
[00:55.05]within our walls.
[00:56.32]Their eyes were drilled in discipline,
[00:58.32]their silence carved in stone,
[01:00.39]To serve a parchment covenant, not fear
[01:02.95]’s corrupted throne.
[01:07.81]Welcome to the War Department, painted
[01:10.45]with a darker shade,
[01:12.12]Where Manifest’s old destiny is twisted
[01:14.92]and replayed.
[01:16.11]Not for foreign deserts, but the boulev
[01:18.35]ards at home,
[01:18.98]Where riflemen are trained to march the
[01:22.18]neighborhoods they roam.
[01:23.93]The Posse law is buried, its century
[01:26.80]faded fast,
[01:28.00]While cyber-dreams and neon schemes are
[01:30.31]welded to the mast.
[01:32.07]The Constitution shifts uneasy, restless
[01:34.86]in its keep,
[01:35.66]And sighs against the G. O. P. fever
[01:38.45]-dreams that haunt its troubled sleep.
[01:44.84]“We lost the way,” Hegseth cries, his
[01:47.63]voice like acid rain,
[01:48.67]“Turned Woke, forgot the catechism car
[01:51.78]ved in iron pain.”
[01:53.53]The Chief would plant battalions in the
[01:55.85]gardens of his street,
[01:57.60]To colonize the homeland with an iron
[02:00.39]-booted beat.
[02:01.67]The generals wear a thousand yards of
[02:04.06]emptiness and gray,
[02:05.74]Their minds a field of silence where no
[02:08.05]partisan flags sway.
[02:09.81]They came from Tokyo barracks, Bavarian
[02:12.60]ridgelines too,
[02:13.48]To watch a mad president conjure storms
[02:16.03]from paranoia’s brew.
[02:19.38]Welcome to the War Department, painted
[02:22.02]with a darker shade,
[02:23.69]Where Manifest’s old destiny is twisted
[02:26.48]and replayed.
[02:27.52]Not for foreign deserts, but the boulev
[02:30.00]ards at home,
[02:31.27]Where riflemen are trained to march the
[02:33.66]neighborhoods they roam.
[02:35.50]The Posse law is buried, its century
[02:38.21]faded fast,
[02:39.41]While cyber-dreams and neon schemes are
[02:41.80]welded to the mast.
[02:43.64]The Constitution shifts uneasy, restless
[02:46.27]in its keep,
[02:47.15]And sighs against the G. O. P. fever
[02:48.83]-dreams that haunt its troubled sleep.
[02:52.73]They slipped out through the exits,
[02:54.81]their patience burned away,
[02:56.88]While Hegseth thundered curses at the br
[02:59.12]ass who wouldn’t stay.
[03:00.87]“Fat generals in the Pentagon, the wit
[03:03.35]ches dressed in suits!
[03:04.94]Which witch is casting shadows, which
[03:07.50]one pulls the roots?”
[03:08.85]“Mandatory fitness litmus!” he howls
[03:11.88]against the void,
[03:13.40]“Test them like the privates, the eight
[03:15.71]een-year-old boys!”
[03:17.31]And whispers weave like smoke rings
[03:19.38]through the dim-lit hall,
[03:21.30]“This is not about the waistline, but a
[03:23.69]darker siren call.”
[03:25.29]The Commander-and-Chief unrolls his ser
[03:27.44]mon, a vow in sharpened rhyme,
[03:29.28]“You can walk, but leave your rank—your
[03:31.59]future’s not your time.
[03:33.59]Your currency is loyalty, your debt is
[03:36.38]to obey,
[03:37.50]The bank of blind allegiance is the al
[03:40.21]tar where you’ll pay.”
[03:41.33]He drops the N-word “nuclear” with a
[03:43.88]grin of crooked pride,
[03:45.39]As though the syllables themselves could
[03:47.87]scorch the countryside.
[03:49.54]“The woke won’t let me say it!” he thund
[03:52.50]ers at the dawn,
[03:53.85]While dangling men’s careers like pupp
[03:56.09]ets on a thread of yarn.
[03:57.60]“I’ve got your backs,” the Chief procla
[03:59.52]ims, “a hundred percent, it’s true,
[04:01.91]If you’ll march the city boulevards,
[04:04.06]make battlefields anew.”
[04:06.14]The generals, bound by scripture inked
[04:08.29]in parchment law,
[04:10.05]Stand mute against the madness, perplex
[04:12.76]ed at what they saw.
[04:16.43]“They wear no uniforms!” he rages in his
[04:20.18]trance,
[04:20.50]Ghost armies of his making in a fevered
[04:23.37]circumstance.
[04:24.41]But federal numbers tell another tale,
[04:26.72]the data won’t agree,
[04:28.64]Yet fear is fed with fantasy, and truth
[04:31.27]is left to flee.
[04:34.06]Welcome to the War Department, where
[04:36.62]reason goes to drown,
[04:38.37]Where party flags are stitched into a ty
[04:40.85]rant’s hand-me-down.
[04:41.96]Where silicon and AI shadows forge invis
[04:45.07]ible chains,
[04:46.11]And liberty is auctioned off for someone
[04:48.82]else’s gains.
[04:49.62]But still beneath the chaos, a fragile
[04:52.97]hope survives,
[04:54.25]In men who keep their solemn oaths, who
[04:56.56]guard the nation’s lives.
[04:58.32]They swore to serve a document, not any
[05:00.95]mortal hand,
[05:02.39]To hold the line for liberty, the Const
[05:05.02]itution’s stand.
[05:07.02]May they endure the carnival, the
[05:09.57]madness, and the fall,
[05:11.32]And keep from making enemies of brothers
[05:14.44]one and all.
[05:15.47]When the smoke of rhetoric is gone, the
[05:17.87]lies all stripped away,
[05:18.82]That oath remains the compass, to
[05:22.10]survive another day.
