[00:09.97]Old Hegseth paints his ladies mask, rouge thick as winter clay,
[00:16.19]Preaches soldier’s gospel—“no mascara or beards in the fray.”
[00:22.57]He blames the bulging bellies for the empire’s slow decline,
[00:27.92]But the mirror mocks his powdered face, and the President's waistline.
[00:35.26]“Resign if you won’t follow me,” he mutters through the paint,
[00:40.45]And silence drapes the generals, their patience worn but faint.
[00:48.03]They flew from foreign garrisons, from Kaisers’ ghostly halls,
[00:52.26]To hear of phantom saboteurs who live within our walls.
[00:56.32]Their eyes were drilled in discipline, their silence carved in stone,
[01:00.39]To serve a parchment covenant, not fear’s corrupted throne.
[01:07.81]Welcome to the War Department, painted with a darker shade,
[01:12.12]Where Manifest’s old destiny is twisted and replayed.
[01:16.11]Not for foreign deserts, but the boulevards at home,
[01:18.98]Where riflemen are trained to march the neighborhoods they roam.
[01:23.93]The Posse law is buried, its century faded fast,
[01:28.00]While cyber-dreams and neon schemes are welded to the mast.
[01:32.07]The Constitution shifts uneasy, restless in its keep,
[01:35.66]And sighs against the GOP fever-dreams that haunt its troubled sleep.
[01:44.84]“We lost the way,” Hegseth cries, his voice like acid rain,
[01:48.67]“Turned Woke, forgot the catechism carved in iron pain.”
[01:53.53]The Chief would plant battalions in the gardens of his street,
[01:57.60]To colonize the homeland with an iron-booted beat.
[02:01.67]The generals wear a thousand yards of emptiness and gray,
[02:05.74]Their minds a field of silence where no partisan flags sway.
[02:09.81]They came from Tokyo barracks, Bavarian ridgelines too,
[02:13.48]To watch a mad president conjure storms from paranoia’s brew.
[02:19.38]Welcome to the War Department, painted with a darker shade,
[02:23.69]Where Manifest’s old destiny is twisted and replayed.
[02:27.52]Not for foreign deserts, but the boulevards at home,
[02:31.27]Where riflemen are trained to march the neighborhoods they roam.
[02:35.50]The Posse law is buried, its century faded fast,
[02:39.41]While cyber-dreams and neon schemes are welded to the mast.
[02:43.64]The Constitution shifts uneasy, restless in its keep,
[02:47.15]And sighs against the GOP fever-dreams that haunt its troubled sleep.
[02:52.73]They slipped out through the exits, their patience burned away,
[02:56.88]While Hegseth thundered curses at the brass who wouldn’t stay.
[03:00.87]“Fat generals in the Pentagon, the witches dressed in suits!
[03:04.94]Which witch is casting shadows, which one pulls the roots?”
[03:08.85]“Mandatory fitness litmus!” he howls against the void,
[03:13.40]“Test them like the privates, the eighteen-year-old boys!”
[03:17.31]And whispers weave like smoke rings through the dim-lit hall,
[03:21.30]“This is not about the waistline, but a darker siren call.”
[03:25.29]The Commander-and-Chief unrolls his sermon, a vow in sharpened rhyme,
[03:29.28]“You can walk, but leave your rank—your future’s not your time.
[03:33.59]Your currency is loyalty, your debt is to obey,
[03:37.50]The bank of blind allegiance is the altar where you’ll pay.”
[03:41.33]He drops the N-word “nuclear” with a grin of crooked pride,
[03:45.39]As though the syllables themselves could scorch the countryside.
[03:49.54]“The woke won’t let me say it!” he thunders at the dawn,
[03:53.85]While dangling men’s careers like puppets on a thread of yarn.
[03:57.60]“I’ve got your backs,” the Chief proclaims, “a hundred percent, it’s true,
[04:01.91]If you’ll march the city boulevards, make battlefields anew.”
[04:06.14]The generals, bound by scripture inked in parchment law,
[04:10.05]Stand mute against the madness, perplexed at what they saw.
[04:16.43]“They wear no uniforms!” he rages in his trance,
[04:20.50]Ghost armies of his making in a fevered circumstance.
[04:24.41]But federal numbers tell another tale, the data won’t agree,
[04:28.64]Yet fear is fed with fantasy, and truth is left to flee.
[04:34.06]Welcome to the War Department, where reason goes to drown,
[04:38.37]Where party flags are stitched into a tyrant’s hand-me-down.
[04:41.96]Where silicon and AI shadows forge invisible chains,
[04:46.11]And liberty is auctioned off for someone else’s gains.
[04:49.62]But still beneath the chaos, a fragile hope survives,
[04:54.25]In men who keep their solemn oaths, who guard the nation’s lives.
[04:58.32]They swore to serve a document, not any mortal hand,
[05:02.39]To hold the line for liberty, the Constitution’s stand.
[05:07.02]May they endure the carnival, the madness, and the fall,
[05:11.32]And keep from making enemies of brothers one and all.
[05:15.47]When the smoke of rhetoric is gone, the lies all stripped away,
[05:18.82]That oath remains the compass, to survive another day.
