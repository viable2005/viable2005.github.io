[00:11.72]Trump intones with riddled speech,
[00:14.04]His syllogisms fractured, truths out of reach.
[00:17.07]Yet GOP disciples heed his call,
[00:22.81]Like Iago’s murmurs, they embrace it all.
[00:28.88]Epstein Files revised with Pam's clumsy hand,
[00:34.38]While acolytes construct from dust a fragile stand.
[00:40.05]They somersault like actors on Shakespeare's stage,
[00:44.04]Making error sound like sage,
[00:46.75]Though their master’s lies unravel at the seams.
[00:52.50]Caught in the labyrinth he designs,
[00:55.61]Though his stories fall like stone,
[00:58.48]Still the faithful GOP enshrines
[01:01.59]Every faltering word he’s thrown.
[01:04.22]They contort, recast, and twist the frame,
[01:07.02]To make delusion sound profound,
[01:08.77]But when contradictions stake their claim,
[01:12.92]The truth comes crashing down.
[01:20.34]Behind closed doors, his fury vents,
[01:22.73]Yet before the crowd, he feigns innocence.
[01:25.61]Trump-Iago’s venom drips in every ear:
[01:31.43]“Defend me from illusions I fear.”
[01:37.18]But tangled tongues betray the scheme,
[01:40.05]Each cross-wired lie unmasks the dream.
[01:42.84]Now his minions stumble, arguments split,
[01:45.71]Their fictions bleed through acrobatic wit,
[01:49.78]When you shield a fool, the cracks will show.
[01:57.52]Freudian lapse - the masque gives way,
[02:00.15]Reality intrudes, night to day.
[02:02.87]Mike Johnson reframes with desperate haste,
[02:05.82]To crown the abuser in virtue’s place.
[02:08.29]“He’s the hero, an FBI informant for the right,”
[02:14.84]Though girls suffered in his shadow overnight.
[02:19.94]Yet Iago's whispers cannot erase
[02:25.69]The rape carved into each haunted womans's face.
[02:43.24]Bondi inverts, redacts, and rewrites the code,
[02:48.90]Mask the child's blood that stains Trump's load.
[02:54.17]“He’s protector of these women’s cause,”
[02:57.12]While hidden are his predator claws.
[03:00.15]But every strand the informant spider spun
[03:04.86]Bears witness to the crimes committed on child-RUN.
[03:08.93]The edifice crumbles, dominoes aligned,
[03:15.00]Truth tears through the circus designed,
[03:18.59]No gilding redeems the rot below.
[03:29.60]Trapped in the labyrinth he designs,
[03:32.71]Though his fables sink like stone,
[03:35.58]Still the faithful GOP enshrines
[03:38.69]Every faltering word he’s thrown.
[03:40.37]They distort, defend, transmute the facts,
[03:44.04]To give his chaos sacred ground,
[03:46.83]But when the contradictions mass in stacks,
[03:49.86]Epstein's truth comes crashing down.
[03:55.93](Crashing down!)
[04:01.35]Survivor's truth comes crashing down!
