[00:11.72]Trump intones with riddled speech,
[00:14.04]His syllogisms fractured, truths out of
[00:16.67]reach.
[00:17.07]Yet G O P disciples heed his call,
[00:22.81]Like Iago’s murmurs, they embrace it
[00:25.93]all.
[00:28.88]Epstein Files revised with Pam's clumsy
[00:32.31]hand,
[00:34.38]While acolytes construct from dust a
[00:37.50]fragile stand.
[00:40.05]They somersault like actors on Shakespe
[00:42.92]are's stage,
[00:44.04]Making error sound like sage,
[00:46.75]Though their master’s lies unravel at
[00:49.86]the seams.
[00:52.50]Caught in the labyrinth he designs,
[00:55.61]Though his stories fall like stone,
[00:58.48]Still the faithful G O P enshrines
[01:01.59]Every faltering word he’s thrown.
[01:04.22]They contort, recast, and twist the fra
[01:06.94]me,
[01:07.02]To make delusion sound profound,
[01:08.77]But when contradictions stake their
[01:12.12]claim,
[01:12.92]The truth comes crashing down.
[01:20.34]Behind closed doors, his fury vents,
[01:22.73]Yet before the crowd, he feigns inno
[01:25.13]cence.
[01:25.61]Trump-Iago’s venom drips in every ear:
[01:31.43]“Defend me from illusions I fear.”
[01:37.18]But tangled tongues betray the scheme,
[01:40.05]Each cross-wired lie unmasks the dream.
[01:42.84]Now his minions stumble, arguments
[01:45.31]split,
[01:45.71]Their fictions bleed through acrobatic
[01:48.82]wit,
[01:49.78]When you shield a fool, the cracks will
[01:52.42]show.
[01:57.52]Freudian lapse — the masque gives way,
[02:00.15]Reality intrudes, night to day.
[02:02.87]Mike Johnson reframes with desperate has
[02:05.34]te,
[02:05.82]To crown the abuser in virtue’s place.
[02:08.29]“He’s the hero, an F B I informant for
[02:13.40]the right,”
[02:14.84]Though girls suffered in his shadowed
[02:17.55]overnight.
[02:19.94]Yet Iago's whispers cannot erase
[02:25.69]The rape carved into each haunted wom
[02:28.40]ans's face.
[02:43.24]Bondi inverts, redacts, and rewrites the
[02:45.95]code,
[02:48.90]Mask the child's blood that stains Tr
[02:51.54]ump's load.
[02:54.17]“He’s protector of these women’s cause,”
[02:57.12]While hidden are his predator claws.
[03:00.15]But every strand the informant spider sp
[03:03.27]un
[03:04.86]Bears witness to the crimes committed on
[03:08.13]childrun.
[03:08.93]The edifice crumbles, dominoes aligned,
[03:15.00]Truth tears through the circus designed,
[03:18.59]No gilding redeems the rot below.
[03:29.60]Trapped in the labyrinth he designs,
[03:32.71]Though his fables sink like stone,
[03:35.58]Still the faithful G O P enshrines
[03:38.69]Every faltering word he’s thrown.
[03:40.37]They distort, defend, transmute the
[03:43.72]facts,
[03:44.04]To give his chaos sacred ground,
[03:46.83]But when the contradictions mass in
[03:49.46]stacks,
[03:49.86]Epstein's truth comes crashing down.
[03:55.93](Crashing down!)
[04:01.35]Survivor's truth comes crashing down!
