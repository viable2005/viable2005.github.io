[00:00.23]In ninety-six, a traveler bypassed the H-1B queue,
[00:05.18]With a squint that suggested she knew exactly what to do.
[00:09.65]They granted her the "Extraordinary Ability" EB-1 prize,
[00:14.44]For the "high professional acclaim" of her cheekbones and her eyes.
[00:18.58]A naturalized icon of the "hush" and the "stare,"
[00:22.42]Now floating through the West Wing with a "don’t touch me" flair.
[00:26.25]She’s checking seating charts in a hundred-minute vlog,
[00:29.83]An administrative odyssey lost in a gold-plated fog.
[00:33.90]She measures every chair on a high-budget reel,
[00:37.65]While the presidency spins like a broken mirrored wheel.
[00:44.84]Behold the ringmaster, Brett Ratner, back from his exile,
[00:48.98]To film a forty-million-dollar infomercial with a smile.
[00:53.37]Bezos paid the "lobbying fee," slid it under her door,
[00:55.93]To watch her walk in slow-mo past a rug on the floor.
[01:00.55]The President calls from the trailer, seeking a crumb of her grace,
[01:04.54]"Did you watch it?" he asks, with hope on his orange-tinted face.
[01:08.29]She replies, "I did not. I will see it on the news,"
[01:12.20]A sentence cold as liquid nitrogen in designer shoes.
[01:16.11]The clock is leaning crooked, every handshake swatted away,
[01:19.94]In Israel and Rome, she let his orange fingers sway.
[01:23.77]He says she wouldn’t weep if his heart finally stopped,
[01:26.72]She says, "Join the club," and the temperature dropped.
[01:31.27]He counts her years out loud, she says, "I’m twenty-three,"
[01:35.50]Trapped in Trump's Go-to age, declared to Epstein with gitty glee!
[01:43.16]Oh, Melania! Hear the digital comment section blaze,
[01:46.91]"If Syphilis were a movie!" yours would review with praise.
[01:50.82]Forty million "thank-you notes" from Bezos’s golden pen,
[01:54.41]A film that portrays at great expense absolutely nothing again.
[01:58.24]The theaters sit empty from Manhattan to the Florida sand,
[02:05.50]While you dance with marching brass in a mocked Trump-Kennedy land.
[02:13.16]EAT THE COOKIES! HER NAME IS STAMPED IN TACKY GOLD!
[02:17.07]WHILE AN ICU NURSE IN MINNEAPOLIS IS LEFT IN THE COLD!
[02:21.14]MIKE TYSON IS THERE! AND THE CEO OF APPLE, TOO!
[02:24.89]WATCHING "HISTORY IN MOTION" WHILE THE COUNTRY TURNS BLUE!
[02:29.12]POPCORN IN MONOCHROME! DRUMS POUNDING THE HALL!
[02:32.23]SCREENING A VANITY MIRROR WHILE THE CEILING STARTS TO FALL!
[02:43.48]Down at the Trump-Kennedy Center, the ghosts are aghast,
[02:47.55]At a $75 million spectacle that was never meant to last.
[02:51.78]The ticket sales are "dismal," a prayer nobody heard,
[02:55.61]Not even the "loyal base" will pay twenty for the word.
[02:59.12]It’s agitprop in slow-motion, a LinkdIn update with a beat,
[03:02.95]A "Succession" rip-off that’s headed for a cinematic defeat.
[03:07.34]Barron’s on TikTok, garnering views that you’ll never see,
[03:10.61]While you pose as "extraordinary" for a corporate lobbying fee.
[03:22.73]Oh, Melania! The "Pretty Woman" remake with a shittier plot,
[03:26.33]A glossy little sermon that Orange-man's little fingers bought.
[03:29.84]"If disease had credits!" the critics all agree,
[03:33.90]It’d fade into the silence where this film is destined to be.
[03:37.58]The family theater is gone, swapped for chandeliers and fear,
[03:41.33]To sell a "timeless story" that was over by the end of last year.
[03:47.55]"I don't really care... do you?" (Spoken, dry as a legal deposition):
[03:49.22]I’m sure the original Pretty Woman had better shoes.
