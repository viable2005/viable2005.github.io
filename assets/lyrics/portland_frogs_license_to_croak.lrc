[00:12.68]Well they said the city was burnin’, smoke risin’ to the crown,
[00:18.35]So they brought in the black helmets, and soldiers by the pound.
[00:23.53]But outside the cold stone fortress, yeah, somethin’ strange was goin’ round—
[00:28.88]There’s a unicorn swingin’ to Cher, and a raccoon spinnin’ upside-down.
[00:34.06]And they pepper-sprayed the vent of a plastic frog that couldn’t breathe,
[00:39.33]While "Operation Inflation" whispered, "We got plenty more beneath."
[00:44.20]Oh, Seth Todd turned into "The Toad," and the people said, "What’s this scene?"
[00:49.14]Now the feds are facin' rubber animals in a parking-lot dream.
[00:58.48]We’re the Portland Frogs, we bounce for democracy,
[01:03.11]Lardo’s pourin’ pints of freedom, amphibian solidarity.
[01:09.97]There’s a Tigger dancin’ softly with a polar bear in peace,
[01:15.15]While the Guard points rifles at a lobster beggin’ for release.
[01:19.30]Oh, ribbit, resist, repeat!—it’s the theater of the free,
[01:25.69]You can’t call it an uprising when we’re dressed as Reptar on TV!
[01:33.11]They said, "They’re anarchists, they’re angry, they’re burnin’ down the night!"
[01:38.93]So we came as sharks and brass horns playin' under satellite light.
[01:44.20]An old man fell before the line, his banner hit the ground,
[01:48.51]While dinosaurs and axolotls just kept jumpin’ all around.
[01:55.05]The Justice men said, "Dangerous!" and shouted, "That's enough!"
[02:00.00]But it’s hard to fear rebellion in a blow-up chicken puff.
[02:05.50]And Governor Newsom tweeted, oh, with laughter in his thread,
[02:11.01]“War-torn Portland!” he mocked the masks, as unicorns danced ahead.
[02:16.43]We’re the Portland Frogs, hop-hop for liberty,
[02:20.18]Three-dollar drafts for freedom, pourin’ at the civic brewery.
[02:28.08]A peacock and a banana suit stand tall against decree,
[02:32.55]While camo men on rooftops hum along to "Turn Back Time" by Cher, you see.
[02:37.81]Oh, Give me Ribberty or Give me Death! —we croak and still we joke,
[02:43.56]You can’t draft an act of treason on a
[02:46.75]chicken doin’ the Macarena in smoke!
[02:49.94]And Brooks Brown saw the photographs, young faces turned to flame,
[02:57.04]So he bought a cart of costumes and said, “We’re playin’ a different game.”
[03:02.31]Joy Wilson reads her paperback dressed as Tigger by the gate,
[03:07.50]While the gas-mask men look puzzled, wonderin’ what sealed their fate.
[03:12.76]And the frogs, they took to preachin’, both for planet and decree,
[03:17.07]“Save the Frogs!” they cried, “Save the Earth, save democracy!”
[03:23.45]They cracked some glass and shuttered down, said “We’ll restore the peace.”
[03:28.48]But we came back in cow suits, singin’ "Solidarity Geeze."
[03:33.98]And a man named Bob Ross painted calm where the stormtroopers stood tall,
[03:39.17]While the naked riders cycled by, sayin’ “You can’t cage whimsy at all.”
[03:44.44]‘Cause a city that breathes absurdity won’t bend beneath a word,
[03:49.86]Where protest’s just performance art, and freedom’s still the absurd.
[03:54.81]“Frogs Together Strong!” the people sang and memed,
[04:00.47]The world tuned in to see cartoons defy a federal regime.
[04:09.97]We’re the Portland Frogs, bouncin’ in blow-up shells,
[04:14.12]Lardo’s tappin’ kegs of courage, and the laughter rings like bells.
[04:18.82]There’s squirrels and bears and dolphins makin’ fascism look unwell,
[04:26.08]‘Cause nothin’ says “war zone” like a toad and a banana suit in swell.
[04:31.43]Oh, ribbit, resist, repeat!—we’re mythic and we’re free!
[04:37.26]You sprayed a frog’s air hole and made him a liberty tree!
[04:41.88]United we ribbit, divided we croak—that’s our prophecy!
[04:47.15]The Guard’s still marchin’—we’re still laughin’—absurdity!
[04:56.48]“Should I get the lobster, man?—nah, I already ordered the squirrel… (buying suits)”
[04:59.92]“All frogs drink for free, brother—ribbit ribbit, let freedom twirl!”
[05:07.50]“This ain’t no war zone, babe—these are just chickens in love with the world.”
